# AirPodsBatteryCLI
CLI tool for Grabbing the AirPods Battery Status

This is a little shell script that uses information from defaults read /Library/Preferences/com.apple.Bluetooth to grab Battery Info from a pair of connected AirPods.

You'll have to edit the line at the top to put the MAC Address of your AirPods in.

This works as of OSX 10.12.6.

There's a better guide on using it here: http://blog.duklabs.com/airpods-power-in-touchbar/
